\section{Compact Operators}
In this section we'll define and investigate compact operators, the class of operators which are closest to the concept of finite rank operators.
\begin{definition}[Compact Operators]\nl
    $X$, $Y$ normed, \func{T}{X}{Y} linear. Then $T$ is a compact operator if $\forall B\subset X$ bounded, $T(B)$ is sequentially Compact.
    
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\nl
    {\color{blue} Compact Operators maps bounded set to (sequentially) compact set.}
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}[Equivalent definitions]\nl
    For $X$, $Y$ Banach, the following are equivalent:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $T$ is compact operator.
        \item $\forall B$ bounded, $T(B)$ is compact.
        \item $T(B_1)$, image of unit ball under $T$ is compact
        \item $\forall\sequ{x_n}\subset X$ bounded, $T(x_n)$ has a Cauchy subsequence.
    \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
